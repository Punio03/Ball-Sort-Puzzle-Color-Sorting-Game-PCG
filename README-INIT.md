# Ball Sort Puzzle Color Sorting Game + PCG
## Abstract

This project explores procedural generation of **Ball Sort Puzzle** levels using **evolutionary algorithms**.
The goal is to investigate whether these methods can generate solvable and diverse puzzles comparable to levels produced by a classical **BFS-based search**. 
By comparing algorithmic and deterministic generation techniques, we aim to evaluate the potential of PCG to improve puzzle variety, difficulty control, and generation efficiency. The study contributes to understanding the applicability of evolutionary PCG methods in mobile puzzle games.

## Background

Mobile puzzle games are widely popular, but many of them suffer from repetitive or poorly designed levels, which negatively impacts player engagement. 
Designing a large number of high-quality puzzle levels manually is difficult and time-consuming, 
making it a common bottleneck in puzzle game development.

Procedural Content Generation (PCG) provides a way to automatically generate puzzle levels and increase diversity. 
Although PCG has been extensively studied, puzzle generation remains a relatively underexplored area, as highlighted in existing surveys on procedural puzzle generation. 
In this project, the Ball Sort Puzzle is used as a test case to explore whether algorithmic generation methods can improve level variety and quality compared to traditional approaches.

## Project goal

The goal of this project is to investigate whether standard Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques, 
in particular evolutionary and genetic algorithms, are capable of generating Ball Sort Puzzle levels of comparable quality to levels generated using a classical deterministic approach based on state-space search.

## Methodology

The project is based on a comparative approach between two puzzle generation methods. 
The baseline method uses a classical search-based technique, 
where new Ball Sort Puzzle levels are generated by applying reverse moves from a solved state and verifying solvability using breadth-first search (BFS). 
Search depth is used as an estimate of puzzle difficulty.

The second method applies Procedural Content Generation using evolutionary techniques, such as genetic algorithms. 
Puzzle levels are treated as individuals in a population and evaluated using a fitness function that considers validity, solvability, and difficulty. 
The quality of levels generated by evolutionary methods is then compared to BFS-generated levels in terms of solvability, difficulty, diversity, and generation cost.
